Here I tried to create everything according to the given instruction if any modification required I am ready to fix it
Firstly I created Info list,then there is option to add category by seleting some info list using map concept
if category is already there it will push info-list which is not in the same category otherwise if category is not exist it will add and there is option to search info-list by category for responsiveness of the webpage I used Tailwindcss.
Thankyou!!
